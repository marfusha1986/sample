    <h1>Special tags that need "more"</h1>
    <h2>button</h2>
<p> Here it is an example of the button tag.
    It is a little bit misleading since it is a button that doesn't do anything.
    You would want to add some interactivity.perhaps with JavaScript.</p>
<button>Open</button><br>
<button>Close</button><br>
<hr>
<h2>meter</h2>
<p>
  The meter tag is cool and can take a lot of attributes.
  But again it is better if you have some code that can make the attribute values
  dynamic instead of "hardcoding" them.When you think meter,think of a final score for a test.</p>
    <meter min="0" max="100" value="50">50%</meter><br>
    <meter min="0" max="1" value=".25">25%</meter><br>
    <meter min="5" max="10" value="8">60%</meter><br>
<hr>
<h2>progress</h2>
<p>The progress tag has a very similar layout to the meter tag.
  The difference is that there is an assumption that has many pages of question.</p>
<progress value="70" max="100">70%</progress>
<hr>
<h2>iframe</h2>
<p>The iframe is used to nest content.It is not supported equally by all browsers.
    You will want to explore setting many of the different options such as height and width.</p>
<iframe src="http://www.intro-webdesign.com"></iframe><br/>
<p>You can set the width  to something greater.</p>
<iframe src="http://www.intro-webdesign.com" width="1200px" height="400px%"></iframe><br/>

<h2>bdo</h2>
<p>bdo stands for bidirectional override.This tag can be used to change the direction of the next.</p>
<p>This text will go left to right.</p>
<p><bdo dir="rtl">This text will go right to left.</bdo></p>
    <p><bdo dir="ltr">This text will go right to left.</bdo></p>
